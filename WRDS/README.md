## How to Get a WRDS Account

In order to use WRDS, you need to register for an account on the WRDS website. Opening a new account is simple and requires only a couple of minutes.

### Step 1: Go to the WRDS Website

Navigate to <a href="https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/</a> and click on the **Register** button.

### Step 2: Select Your Institution

In the first menu, select your university. For students of Utrecht University, select **Utrecht University**.

### Step 3: Choose Your Affiliation

For **Affiliation with Institution**, select the option that best fits your role (e.g., Undergraduate, Masters, PhD, Faculty).

### Step 4: Complete the Registration Form

Fill in the required details. Note that **usernames are permanent** and cannot be modified once you have requested your account. Check with your institution's representative if there are any username requirements before creating your account.

### Step 5: Wait for Approval

After submitting your registration, you will receive an email with login instructions once the WRDS administrators approve your request. Approval may take up to 48 hours.

### Important Notes

- The default expiration for student accounts is **2 years**.
- WRDS policy prohibits undergraduate/master's students from accessing WRDS during the extended break between semesters. Accounts are temporarily disabled during this time and automatically re-enabled when the new semester begins.
- If you need access to a specific database or have questions, send an email to **financedata.use@uu.nl** with your name, position/degree programme (BSc/MSc), type of data required, and details of your request.
